# Django Static Site Generator

Create a static site easily using the power of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)!

## What is it?

`dssg` is a tool to create static sites from a [source directory](https://github.com/atheiman/dssg/wiki/Example-Source-Dir). Your static site can be made up of any combination of the following elements:

- *Pages* (`/index.html`)
- *Categorized Pages* (`/technology/index.html`)
- *Categorized Posts* (`/technology/google-nexus-6-and-9.html`)

To get an idea of what this is all about, poke around in the [example source directory](https://github.com/atheiman/dssg/tree/master/example-source-dir). Then, checkout the [static site it generates](https://github.com/atheiman/dssg/) in the dssg GH project page.

This project is a work in progress.
